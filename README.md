**COMMAND-LINE CALCULATOR**
The input evaluation process in this program involves calling the evaluate() method with the user's input to calculate the result. Within a try block, various exceptions are caught: ArithmeticException for handling division by zero or other arithmetic errors, NumberFormatException for detecting invalid operators, and a general Exception for any other expression errors. The method then prints either the result or an appropriate error message.

In the evaluate method, the input string is split into operands and operators using a regular expression. These operands are then parsed as double values, and the specified operation (addition, subtraction, etc.) is performed based on the operator using a switch statement. To prevent division by zero errors, the method checks if the divisor is not zero before performing division. For comparison operations, the compareOperands method is invoked.You can calculate the factorial of any number using the factorial() method.

The compareOperands() method compares two operands using the specified comparison operator (less than or greater than) and returns a boolean result. This structured approach ensures accurate evaluation of arithmetic expressions and comparisons, enabling the program to handle a variety of user inputs effectively.

**TASK MANAGEMENT APPLICATION**
The task management application is a web-based system designed to help users organize and track their tasks efficiently. It offers the following key features:

Task CRUD Operations:

Users can add, edit, and remove tasks through a user-friendly interface.
Each task includes details such as title, due date, priority level, and completion status.
Priority-Based Sorting:

Tasks are sorted based on their priority levels (high, medium, low) to help users focus on critical tasks first.
Priority sorting ensures that users can quickly identify and tackle urgent tasks.
Task Completion Tracking:

Users can mark tasks as completed when finished, providing a sense of accomplishment and progress tracking.
Completed tasks are archived and can be viewed separately from the active tasks.
User Interface:

The application provides a clean and intuitive user interface for seamless task management.
Various views are available to display tasks, including a list of active tasks and a separate list of completed tasks.
Persistence:

Task data is persisted in a database, ensuring that users' task lists are stored securely and can be accessed across sessions.
Spring Data JPA is used for database interactions, offering easy integration with relational databases.
Technology Stack:

Spring Framework: Provides the backbone for building the application, handling dependency injection, and implementing MVC architecture.
Spring Data JPA: Simplifies database operations by providing repository interfaces and reducing boilerplate code.
Java 8 Date and Time API: Used for handling task due dates, offering improved functionality over traditional date classes.
Scalability and Extensibility:

The application is designed with scalability and extensibility in mind, allowing for future enhancements and additional features.
It follows best practices in software development, such as separation of concerns and modularity, making it easier to maintain and extend.
Overall, the task management application offers a robust solution for individuals or teams to manage their tasks effectively, improving productivity and organization. Whether it's for personal use or team collaboration, the application provides a convenient way to stay on top of tasks and deadlines.
